  <p>Hi, my name is I am a student at HU! I'm learning to code right now! I am going to Florida during spring break and it's going to be great. I am a film major and I am also a photographer. I am excited to take photos and videos while I'm on vacation. I play the guitar and the drums and I'm even in a band! <br> Some things I enjoy photographing are weddings, families, candid moments, street photography, and portraits.</p>

  <p></p> is where I order my camera equipment from! <a href="https://www.keh.com </p>"
